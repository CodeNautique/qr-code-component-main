## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that it was easier to start a project in mobile-first workflow than desktop-first workflow.

Moreover, I learnt to use figma for this project. And I used variables CSS.

### Continued development

I think I could used simple property CSS, but to accelerate the proccess I had used variables CSS.
